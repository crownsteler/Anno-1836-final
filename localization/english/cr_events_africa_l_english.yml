Yet ever since the emperor Iyoas was murdered and the Princes grabbed power, it is hard to talk about Ethiopia as a singular empire, with the provincial governors ruling their provinces virtually independently and incessant warfare for the tiniest bit of more power. Now, on the hundreth aniversary of Iyoas' murder, it is the clear that the Emperor is little more than an empty husk destined to slowly fade into the annals of history while the new order sets in..."

Others speak of a lighter hand—of guiding the [SCOPE.sCountry('xhosa_scope').GetNameNoFormatting] under a protectorate, keeping the peace through counsel rather than conquest.
