 #Country intro texts
 NET_FLAVOR_TEXT:0 "The Netherlands emerged from the Napoleonic Wars deeply indebted and in an unhappy marriage with its Belgian provinces and their Catholic population,. Now, six years after king William's heavy handed attempts to unify the country caused the secession of the Belgian provinces, will the Netherlands be able to come to terms with this loss and look elsewhere to its future -perhaps the colonies- or will it try to re-establish itself once more in Belgium?"
 DEI_FLAVOR_TEXT:0 "For centuries the fertile soil, exotic goods and hard work of its people have made the East Indies the place to be for enterprising Europeans -Dutchmen- hoping to make their fortunes. Now, with the Netherlands still reeling from the Belgian secession and a cripling debt, will the East Indies be able to step up to the plate and provide the Netherlands with a much needed economic lifeline?"
 TUA_FLAVOR_TEXT:0 "South of Algeria, deep in the desert, lie the oases of Touat which control the trade routes across the Sahara. Their isolation protecting them from foreign domination, but for how much longer?"
 CHC_FLAVOR_TEXT:0 "In 1828 several Muslim imams in Dagestan and Chechnya called for Gazawat -a holy war- against Russia, which had ruled the region since taking it from Persia in the Treaty of Gulistan. Proclaiming an independent Imamate of the Caucasus, they and their followers have waged a guerilla separatist war against Russia ever since. Will they be able to continue holding out against Russia?"
 PNI_FLAVOR_TEXT:0 "After independence, the gauchos of the Brazilian Pampas felt excluded from the nation's political process and resented economic policies that harmed the south. In 1835 these tensions erupted in a separatist rebellion, which proclaimed a Republic of the Rio Grande. But how long this fledging nation can last, noone knows."
 LIB_FLAVOR_TEXT:0 "In the early 1820s a number of American 'colonization societies' established outposts on the Pepper Coast of Africa, to which they encouraged freed American slaves to remove themselves. In 1822 several of these colonies united and proclaimed the foundation of the new nation of Liberia, intended as a bastion of liberty on the dark continent and a perpetual home for African-Americans. Will it be able to live up to this promise of a new home for freed slaves?"
 AHG_FLAVOR_TEXT:0 "High upon the stony plains of the central Sahara rise the mountains of Ahaggar—a land of wind, stone, and silence. Here, among ancient wadis and volcanic peaks, the Tuareg Kel Ahaggar rule the desert trails, their camels bearing salt, gold, and slaves between Sudan and the Maghreb. Nominally subjects of distant rulers, they bow to none but their own amenokal. Will their strength, honour, and the shifting fortunes of the caravan routes protect them against foreing adversaries in the shifting sands of this new century?"
 AIR_FLAVOR_TEXT:0 "In the heart of the Sahara stands Aïr, a rugged massif of stone and sand rising above the endless desert. From its valleys, the Tuareg of the Kel Air command the caravan routes between Tripoli, Kano, and Timbuktu—guarding, taxing, and raiding the lifeblood of the desert trade. Yet their dominion is precarious: rival clans contest their power, the routes grow uncertain, and the encroaching empires of the coast cast long shadows northward. Will Aïr remain the gatekeeper of the central Sahara, or will the desert winds sweep away its ancient pride?"
 FTR_FLAVOR_TEXT:0 "Nestled along the fertile banks of the Senegal River, Futa Tooro has long been a cradle of learning, faith, and prosperity. Here, the torodbe clerics overthrew old kings and established a realm where Islamic law guides both town and field, and where the harvests of rice, millet, and sorghum feed scholars and warriors alike. Yet the republic is fragile—rival marabouts, ambitious clans, and foreign traders tug at its unity. As French influence creeps upriver and old loyalties strain, will Futa Tooro preserve its rich lands and scholarly tradition, or be swept aside by the tides of empire?
 TBI_FLAVOR_TEXT:0 "Rising like islands from a sea of sand, the mountains of Tibesti form one of the last true fortresses of the Sahara. Here, among black peaks and hidden wadis, the Teda clans live by their own law—warriors, herders, and raiders who know every pass and well between Fezzan and Bornu. Their isolation has kept them free from sultans and soldiers alike, but also poor and divided. As the powers of the desert and the coast grow stronger, will the fierce people of Tibesti remain masters of their mountains—or be drawn into the struggles of the world beyond?"
 TRZ_FLAVOR_TEXT:0 "Between the dunes of the Sahara and the floodplains of the Senegal lies Trarza, where desert emirs rule over caravan routes and coastal trade alike. From their tents, the Haratin nobles levy tribute on merchants, warriors, and the black kingdoms to the south, balancing the rival influences of Moorish tradition and French ambition. Yet the lure of commerce brings danger as well as wealth, and the old ways waver before new powers pressing from the coast. Will Trarza’s emirs preserve their dominion between desert and river—or be swept aside by the tide of empire?"
