No matter how small their clan, or how long the journey, from all over the Tien Shan they have come.

 cr_kazakh_events.1.t: "The Road to Central Asia"
 cr_kazakh_events.1.d: "Just beyond our southern border lie the storied cities of Central Asia—[SCOPE.sCountry('khiva').GetName], [SCOPE.sCountry('kokand').GetName], [SCOPE.sCountry('bukhara').GetName]— ancient centers of wealth, faith, and influence. Their bazaars humming with the legacy of the Silk Road, their rulers command powerful khanates, and their capture would mark the triumph of Russian ambition in the heart of Asia.\n\nBut they remain out of reach, separated from us by the vast steppe—a lawless expanse of open grasslands, home to nomads, raiders, and scattered clans. To reach the cities, the steppe must first be brought to heel. No flag will fly over Bukhara until it flies first over the grasslands that guard it."
 cr_kazakh_events.1.f: "There are no roads, no central authority, no firm lines to draw on maps. Only the wind, the horse, and the rifle."
 cr_kazakh_events.1.a: "Begin the campaign into the steppe."

 cr_kazakh_events.1.b: "Our attention lies elsewhere—for now."
 cr_kazakh_events.1.b_tt: "Colonization of Central Asia will proceed more slowly."
 cr_kazakh_events.1.t_2: "The Untamed Steppe"
 cr_kazakh_events.1.d_2: "Beyond the orderly provinces of European Russia lies a vast, windswept frontier—open grasslands stretching endlessly toward the sun-scorched mountains of Central Asia.\n\nThese Kazakh steppes remain, for now, loosely controlled—inhabited by nomads and fractured tribes, far from the civilizing hand of the Tsar. But within the halls of government and the ranks of the army, voices grow louder calling for the extension of Russian order, Russian law, and Russian influence deep into the heart of Asia."
 cr_kazakh_events.1.f_2: "We must bring the frontier under the cross, the crown, and the census roll."
 cr_kazakh_events.1.a_2: "The steppe must be brought to heel."
 cr_kazakh_events.1.a_tt_2: "Expand Russian influence into Central Asia and establish lasting control over the Kazakh territories."
 
 cr_kazakh_events.2.t_old: "A Khan for the Steppe"
 cr_kazakh_events.2.t: "The Horns of Rebellion"
 cr_kazakh_events.2.d: "A dangerous challenge has taken shape across the Kazakh steppes. The clans, notoriously fractious and prone to feuding, have always been easier to manage than to control. Yet the troublesome [SCOPE.sCharacter('kenesary_scope').GetFirstName] has done what none before him could: he has gathered the tribes in a grand Kurultai and been proclaimed [SCOPE.sCharacter('kenesary_scope').GetPrimaryRoleTitle], reclaiming the title once held by his grandfather, Ablai Khan.\n\nWith the clans rallying under a single banner, our ambition for [SCOPE.sStrategicRegion('central_asia').GetName] faces a new and unpredictable obstacle. Even so, [SCOPE.sCharacter('kenesary_scope').GetFirstNameNoFormatting] extends a hand alongside the sword, offering fealty to the [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetPrimaryRoleTitle] should his claim be recognized. Diplomacy, defiance, or cunning—only time will reveal which it is."
 cr_kazakh_events.2.f: "From the northern pastures to the deserts beyond the Syr Darya, riders now flock to his banner, bound by blood, faith, and the fading memory of their old independence. His words spread faster than our patrols can ride: the promise of unity, the defiance of rule from afar."
 cr_kazakh_events.2.a: "What we sought to pacify now stirs against us."
 cr_kazakh_events.2.b: "If a title buys peace, let him have it."
 cr_kazakh_events.2.c: "The steppe has a Khan once more!"
 
 cr_kazakh_events.3.t: "The Steppe Unites"
 cr_kazakh_events.3.desc: "The years have passed, and the steppe has not yielded. Each expedition rode out with banners high and returned weary, its victories fading like dust in the wind. Now, as our strength wanes and our presence recedes, Kenesary’s name carries weight beyond any single clan. One by one, the auls turn to him—not out of defiance, but because no other power remains to heed them."
 cr_kazakh_events.3.flavour: "The empire lost its way in the grass, and the steppe found its voice.”
 cr_kazakh_events.3.a: "The steppe, long divided, has found its center.”
 cr_kazakh_events.3.b: "The steppe will remember this day.”
 
 cr_kazakh_events.4.t: "The Khan of the Reborn Steppe"
 cr_kazakh_events.4.desc: "As turmoil grips the empire, Kenesary’s call echoes louder across the plains. Russian forts stand half-abandoned, their garrisons drawn away by civil strife. Into this void rides Kenesary, uniting the scattered clans under one banner. Where once he was a fugitive, he now rides as a sovereign—his horsemen guarding the steppe from the Ural to the Syr Darya."
 cr_kazakh_events.4.flavour: "When the empire turns inward, the steppe looks to its own.”
 cr_kazakh_events.4.a: "The frontier is lost, for now.”
 cr_kazakh_events.4.b: "The steppe will remember this day.”
 
 cr_kazakh_events.5.t: "The Khan of the Reborn Steppe"
 cr_kazakh_events.5.desc: "With Russia’s strength diminished and her influence waning, the grip on the steppe weakens. The forts crumble, the Cossack patrols grow scarce, and the Kazakh clans reclaim their old grazing grounds. In the vacuum left behind, Kenesary’s name once more stirs hearts—a symbol of resistance reborn as empire falters."
 cr_kazakh_events.5.flavour: "Where the eagle no longer flies, the wolf returns.”
 cr_kazakh_events.5.a: "Our reach no longer extends that far.”
 cr_kazakh_events.5.b: "The steppe remembers who it once belonged to.”

  
 cr_kazakh_events.10.t: "Unrest on the Steppe"
 cr_kazakh_events.10.desc: "The frontier grows uneasy. Cossack patrols report rising defiance among the Kazakh clans—caravans raided, outposts harassed, and envoys turned away. Reforms meant to bring order have instead stirred resentment, as old loyalties fray and new leaders whisper of resistance.\n\nA recent attack on a convoy near Petropavlovsk has alarmed the border stations. Some blame restless warriors seeking revenge; others speak of a noble named [SCOPE.sCharacter('kenesary_scope').GetFirstName] gathering discontented riders beneath his banner.\nWhatever the cause, the steppes are restless once more."

 cr_kazakh_events.10.b: "Appease the clans with trade and leniency."

 cr_kazakh_events.11.t: "The Raid on Akmolinsk"
 cr_kazakh_events.11.desc: "News from the steppe is rarely good, and this time is no exception. The frontier post at Akmolinsk has been overrun by a band of Kazakh raiders and sacked, its stores plundered and a number of soldiers carried off into the steppe.\n\nWhile raids and skirmishes are nothing new, the sheer boldness of this one has unsettled even the most hardened officers. Some say it was the work of ordinary bandits; others whisper again the name of [SCOPE.sCharacter('kenesary_scope').GetFirstName], the ambitious noble rumored to be gathering disaffected clans. Whatever the truth, order on the steppe remains as uncertain as ever."
 cr_kazakh_events.11.desc_old: "Disturbing news has reached Omsk: a Kazakh warband, said to number several thousand, has struck at the frontier post of Akmolinsk. Under cover of darkness they surrounded the fort, set its outbuildings ablaze, and overwhelmed the small garrison. When relief arrived, the raiders had vanished—taking with them supplies, livestock, and several prisoners.\n\nSuch audacity is unheard of on the steppe. Some say it was the work of ordinary bandits; others whisper again the name of [SCOPE.sCharacter('kenesary_scope').GetFirstName], the ambitious noble rumored to be gathering disaffected clans. Whether the attack was chance or omen, one thing is certain—the frontier is no longer quiet."
 cr_kazakh_events.11.flavour: "The wind carries more than dust across the steppe—it carries rumor, and rumor breeds unrest."
 cr_kazakh_events.11.a: "Dispatch a punitive column to reassert control."
 cr_kazakh_events.11.b: "Dispatch envoys to the clans before this spreads."
 
 cr_kazakh_events.12.t: "The Gathering on the Steppe"
 cr_kazakh_events.12.desc: "The steppe stirs with unease. Messengers ride between distant auls, and campfires once lit in isolation now burn in unison. Old feuds are set aside as talk spreads of lost rights, foreign rule, and vengeance for the fallen. Where quarrels once divided the clans, a shared purpose begins to bind them.\n\nAmong those answering the call is [SCOPE.sCharacter('kenesary_ally_char').GetFirstName] of the [SCOPE.sCountry('kenesary_ally_tag').GetNameNoFlag], who has sworn the [SCOPE.sCharacter('kenesary_ally_char').GetLastNameNoFormatting] to the cause of [SCOPE.sCharacter('kenesary_scope').GetFirstName]."
 cr_kazakh_events.12.desc_old: "The raids have grown bolder, the bands larger. Smoke rises from the borderlands again—too often, and too far apart, to be mere coincidence. Across the plains, old rivalries seem to fade as new oaths are sworn around shared fires.\n\nThe name whispered before now carries weight: [SCOPE.sCharacter('kenesary_scope').GetFirstName]. Once a minor noble with grievances, he now draws to his side the restless and the dispossessed, promising them justice, or perhaps revenge."
 cr_kazakh_events.12.flavour: "The raids have grown bolder, the bands larger. Smoke rises again from the edge of the frontier—too far apart, and too often, to be chance. Across the plains, rival clans that once fought each other now share their fires and ride beneath common banners."
 cr_kazakh_events.12.a: "Dispatch a punitive column to reassert control."
 cr_kazakh_events.12.a_tt: "This option is available because we haven't had a recent expedition and we have information on [SCOPE.sCharacter('kenesary_scope').GetFirstNameNoFormatting]'s general whereabouts."
 cr_kazakh_events.12.b: "The embers of rebellion begin to glow."
 
 cr_kazakh_events.13.t: "The Steppe Slips Away"
 cr_kazakh_events.13.desc: "The expedition sent to hunt down [SCOPE.sCharacter('kenesary_scope').GetFirstName] has at last met him upon the open steppe. The fighting was sharp and brief—our volleys broke his riders and scattered their herds. Many of his followers fell, their banners trampled into the dust.\n\nYet the man himself slipped the noose. [SCOPE.sCharacter('kenesary_scope').GetFirstNameNoFormatting] has vanished into the empty plains, leaving only ashes and the dead behind him. His camp is taken, his stores lost, his name cursed by those who followed him. For now, his strength is broken—but not gone."
 cr_kazakh_events.13.flavour: "On the steppe, even defeat can vanish over the horizon."
 cr_kazakh_events.13.a: "He will return. They always do."
 
 cr_kazakh_events.14.t: "Driven Beyond the Horizon"
 cr_kazakh_events.14.desc: "The expedition sent to punish [SCOPE.sCharacter('kenesary_scope').GetFirstName] found no single battle—only dust, smoke, and scattered skirmishes across the steppe. Each time our columns advanced, his riders melted into the plains; each time we rested, they struck again.\n\nAt last, [SCOPE.sCharacter('kenesary_scope').GetFirstNameNoFormatting] and his followers have slipped beyond the southern horizon, their camps abandoned and their herds driven before them."
 cr_kazakh_events.14.flavour: "The steppe swallows them whole, as it always does. The border is quiet for now, yet the emptiness beyond feels uneasy—as if waiting for the wind to shift once more."
 cr_kazakh_events.14.a: "At least the border breathes again—for a time."
 cr_kazakh_events.14.a_tt: "It will be some time before [SCOPE.sCharacter('kenesary_scope').GetFirstName] appears again."
 
 cr_kazakh_events.15.t: "The Steppe Strikes Back"
 cr_kazakh_events.15.desc: "The expedition sent against [SCOPE.sCharacter('kenesary_scope').GetFirstName] met its fate far from any road or fortress. His riders harried our columns day and night, cutting supply lines, stealing horses, and vanishing into the dust.\n\nWhen battle was finally joined, the wind turned against us. The steppe became fire and confusion; guns jammed with sand, and men lost their way in the smoke. Few returned to tell the tale. The rest lie buried beneath the grass, their weapons taken as trophies, their failure whispered in the camps along the frontier."
 cr_kazakh_events.15.flavour: "The steppe remembers its own—strangers are not forgiven easily."
 cr_kazakh_events.15.a: "So the hunter becomes the hunted."
 
 cr_kazakh_events.16.t: "Across the Empty Steppe"
 cr_kazakh_events.16.desc: "The expedition marched far and fought often, but the rebel columns melted into the horizon. Each skirmish ended as it began—with smoke, dust, and hoofprints fading into the wind. Kenesary remains at large, his followers scattered but unbroken."
 cr_kazakh_events.16.flavour: "The steppe hides those who know it best."
 cr_kazakh_events.16.a: "The steppe cannot be tamed in a single season."
 
 cr_kazakh_events.17.t: "Pushed Beyond the Plains"
 cr_kazakh_events.17.desc: "Our forces pressed hard against the rebels, driving them deeper into the barren steppe. Though no decisive battle was fought, Kenesary’s followers are weary, their herds lost, and their camps in disarray. The frontier, for now, lies quiet once more."
 cr_kazakh_events.17.flavour: "They flee farther each time, but the wind always carries their songs back."
 cr_kazakh_events.17.a: "Good. Let the steppe remember our reach."
 
 cr_kazakh_events.18.t: "The Scattered Auls"
 cr_kazakh_events.18.desc: "The expedition sent to the steppes has at last met some measure of success. Marching through [SCOPE.sState('kazak_event_neighbour_state').GetStateRegion.GetName], our columns came upon several auls known to shelter [SCOPE.sCharacter('kenesary_scope').GetFirstName]’s followers. The villages were swiftly taken —herds driven off, stores seized, and many captives made. Among them are said to be kin of the rebel himself.\n\nThough [SCOPE.sCharacter('kenesary_scope').GetFirstNameNoFormatting] eluded capture, his cause has suffered a clear setback, and his men scatter to protect what little remains of their homes."
 cr_kazakh_events.18.flavour: "The steppe is wide, but even its sons must sleep somewhere."
 cr_kazakh_events.18.a: "Welcome news."
 
 cr_kazakh_events.19.t: "Victory on the Steppe"
 cr_kazakh_events.19.desc: "In open battle at dawn, our expedition at last met Kenesary’s riders on the plain. After fierce fighting, the rebels broke and fled, leaving behind their dead, their banners, and their pride. The steppe lies subdued—for now."
 cr_kazakh_events.19.flavour: "Even the wind paused to watch the smoke drift eastward."
 cr_kazakh_events.19.a: "A hard-won victory. The frontier breathes easier tonight."
 
 cr_kazakh_events.20.t: "A Reverse on the Steppe"
 cr_kazakh_events.20.desc: "The expedition met fiercer resistance than anticipated. Kenesary’s riders struck with precision and fury, harassing the column from every ridge and ravine. Supply wagons burned, outposts vanished into smoke, and mounting casualties left the commander no choice but to retreat to [SCOPE.sState('kazak_event_state').GetCityHubName] to preserve what remained of his force."
 cr_kazakh_events.20.flavour: "The steppe spares neither the reckless nor the weary."
 cr_kazakh_events.20.a: "A costly lesson—withdraw and regroup."
 
 cr_kazakh_events.21.t: "Ambush in the Steppe"
 cr_kazakh_events.21.desc: "Our expedition, sent to bring [SCOPE.sCharacter('kenesary_scope').GetFirstName] to heel, has met with misfortune. While traversing a barren stretch of the steppe, a detachment of the column was set upon at dawn by mounted raiders. The attack was sudden and well-coordinated—supply wagons burned, scouts overrun, and before the troops could form a proper line, the assailants had melted back into the plains.\n\nWith casualties mounting and provisions destroyed, the commander deemed it impossible to continue the advance and has withdrawn the expedition to [SCOPE.sState('kazak_event_state').GetCityHubName] to regroup. [SCOPE.sCharacter('kenesary_scope').GetFirstNameNoFormatting] remains at large, his defiance undiminished."
 cr_kazakh_events.21.flavour: "The steppe swallowed them as easily as it spat them forth."
 cr_kazakh_events.21.desc_old: "Our expedition advanced deep into the steppe in pursuit of [SCOPE.sCharacter('kenesary_scope').GetFirstName], only to find the hunter turned prey. In a sudden assault from the ridges, the rebels fell upon our rearguard and supply train, scattering the baggage and burning the wagons before vanishing once more into the endless grass.\n\nThough the main column remained intact, the losses in men and materiel are severe, and morale has suffered. [SCOPE.sCharacter('kenesary_scope').GetFirstName] has again proven his cunning—striking hard, then dissolving into the horizon."
 cr_kazakh_events.21.flavour_old: "The wind carries away the smoke of battle, but not the memory of defeat."
 cr_kazakh_events.21.a: "He slips away again..."
 
 cr_kazakh_events.30.t: "The Weight of the Yoke"
 cr_kazakh_events.30.desc: "Our rule over the steppe brings order — and resentment. Each tax collector, each patrol, reminds the clans that the land is no longer theirs alone. Loyalty is uncertain, and resentment simmers beneath the surface — some urge firmer control, others warn that force will only feed the fires of defiance."
 cr_kazakh_events.30.desc_old: "The steppe has seen many masters, yet the clans remain, their loyalties shifting with the wind. Our rule brings order, but also resentment; every tax collector and patrol reminds them that the land is no longer theirs alone.\n\nSome call for firmer control to root out disobedience. Others warn that force breeds only rebellion."
 cr_kazakh_events.30.flavour: "A Kazakh elder once told a Russian officer: 'We bend under two yokes — the herds we drive and the rulers who drive us.'"
 cr_kazakh_events.30.a: "Tighten control and remind them who rules the steppe."
 cr_kazakh_events.30.b: "Show restraint—let time soften their resentment."

 cr_kazakh_events.31.desc: "The Kazakhs of [SCOPE.sState('kazak_event_neighbour_state').GetStateRegion.GetName] still roam with their herds, following the grass and the seasons, untroubled by the borders drawn on our maps. They cross from pasture to pasture—and sometimes across imperial lines—recalling our authority only when a patrol demands tribute or papers they cannot read.

 cr_kazakh_events.32.desc: "On the steppes the only certainty is consistent change. As an aul can be here today and gone tomorrow, so can allegiances shift from one season to the next.\n\nIn an effort to secure the favour of the Kazakh elders in [SCOPE.sState('kazak_event_neighbour_state').GetStateRegion.GetName] and bind their auls to [ROOT.GetCountry.GetNameNoFormatting], an offering of tea, salt, and cloth—gifts, not bribes—has been suggested."
 cr_kazakh_events.32.flavour: "The Kazakhs are a fickle people, their auls kingdoms unto themselves. Allegiance shifts as swiftly as the wind across the grasslands; today’s friend may ride with another tomorrow. Loyalty, such as it exists, belongs first to kin, then to clan, and rarely beyond."
