 KZK_FLAVOR_TEXT:0 "Endless and endless expanses of red sand, only interrupted by the occasional oasis. It has no value but for the caravans crossing it."
 KRK_FLAVOR_TEXT:0 "The Great Karakum. Completely uninhabitable and completely worthless. Its only use is for caravans to cross.  These caravans are however of great value, and he who controls the trading cities, controls the caravans..."
 NFD_FLAVOR_TEXT:0 "The An-Nefud and Syrian desert form natural borders in the north of Arabia. Barely inhabited, or indeed habitable, so far nobody has bothered making it their own. "
 RUB_FLAVOR_TEXT:0 "The Great Rub'al Khali desert seperates Arabia from the Indian Ocean and the states on its coast. Barely inhabited, or indeed habitable, nobody has yet bothered to claim it as their own."

 JLN_FLAVOR_TEXT:0 "Once the Mek Nimr ruled a vast area of the Sudan as the king of Shedi, but that all changed on that faithful day when he met Ismail, son of Muhammed Ali: Ismail inflicted a grievous insult and Mek Nimr responded with vengeance: burning down the house Ismail had so foolishly decided to camp in that night. On his turn, Muhammad Ali's reaction to the killing of his son was devastating; ordering the Defterdar to inflict inhuman cruelties on Mek Nimr's capital of Shendi before burning it to the ground.\n\nBereft of his center of power, Mek Nimr and his remnants were forced into the borderlands with Ethiopia, where he now eeks out a living raiding Egyptian outposts. Will Mek Nimr be resigned to this fate, or will he be able to orchestrate a triumphant return to Shedi and force the Egyptians from the Sudan?"

 ADA_FLAVOR_TEXT:0 "The decision by his clan elders to sent Adama ɓii Ardo Hassana west to Sokoto and ascertain Shehu Usman's intentions would prove to be a fateful one. Setting of on his journey as a mere emissary, he would return as Usman's choosen man. Assigned with the sacred task of bringing Islam to the unbelievers of the Fombina and await the arrival for Mahdi, who was said to be coming from the east.\n\nThat was almost 30 years ago and the Mahdi is yet to be seen. Will Adama live to see his rise, or will his mission have proven to be in vain?"
 SSS_FLAVOR_TEXT:0 "For centuries, the Sultans of Morocco have claimed authority from the Atlantic to the Sahara—but their word has not carried far beyond the walls of their cities. Beyond the reach of the Makhzen lies the Bilād as-Sība, the ‘Land of Dissidence’, where tribes acknowledge the Sultan in prayer yet rule themselves in practice. United only by faith and custom, these clans guard their freedom fiercely, resisting taxation, law, and the encroaching power of the throne. Will the Sultan’s writ finally extend over the wild hinterlands—or will the mountains and deserts remain the domain of the free?"
 FZN_FLAVOR_TEXT:0 "Deep in the Libyan desert lies Fezzan, a land of oases and shifting sands bound together by the lifelines of the trans-Saharan trade. From Murzuk, caravans laden with salt, slaves, and gold wind their way north to Tripoli and south to Bornu, enriching those who control the routes. Yet Fezzan’s strength rests on fragile foundations—its wealth dependent on distant markets and its rulers beholden to Ottoman and local powers alike. As the old trade paths falter and new empires rise along the coast, will Fezzan endure as the heart of the desert—or be buried beneath its sands?"
